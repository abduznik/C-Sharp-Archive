# C# Archive

This repository serves as an archive for all the C# code I have worked on over time. It contains a diverse collection of projects, scripts, and snippets showcasing my experience and growth in the C# programming language.

## Compiler

To facilitate the compilation process, this repository includes a simple command-line tool called `compiler.cs` and its compiled executable `compiler.exe`. This tool allows you to compile your C# code directly from the command prompt.

Usage:
1. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your C# source files.
2. Run the `compiler.exe` with the following command:
compiler.exe <source_file>



compiler.exe <source_file.cs>


Replace `<source_file.cs>` with the name of your C# source file.

3. If the compilation is successful, an executable with the same name as the source file will be generated in the same directory.

Note: This is a basic compiler tool, and more advanced compilation options or project configurations may require the use of a full-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.

Feel free to explore the various projects and code snippets in this archive. Each directory or file may contain its own README file with specific instructions or documentation.

Happy coding!
